# lab_4: Exploring GIS using turf.js
This code creates a web map of Toronto covered in a hexgrid with a colour ramp representing the number of collisions in each hexagon.
The map uses Mapbox, Turf.js, and Bootstrap.
The data are from the City of Toronto, 2023. 
This open dataset contains data from s006-2021 on the location, time, and other conditions of motor vehicle collisions where a pedestrian was seriously inured or killed.
The original data can be accesses here: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-involving-killed-or-seriously-injured-persons/
